 Write a program to solve the above problem in high level source code such as C and C++.
•  You have to utilzie the function calls instead of using a single verbose function to do all the works.
•  Translate your program into assembly language. Compare your code with https://godbolt.org/.

•  Build a memory/stack address system and CPU registers. You can assume that each assembly instruciton takes 4 bytes or 8 bytes. The registers can be accessed by different names upon the data size: only consider 32 and 64. You should consider the program counter/rip as well.
•  Use a simplified input/output system. You can assume that the keyboard and screen are just a range of memory spaces.
•  Create a GUI. The GUI should contains the source/assmebly editor, the register table, the stack table, the function look-up table, the memory table (stack, bss, data and text).
